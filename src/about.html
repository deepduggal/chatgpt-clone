    <h2>Note to Instructor(s)/Grader(s)</h2>
    <p>The API key will be deleted after grading. The API requests will stop working after the $5 budget is reached. A
      short message costs < $0.01.</p>
        <p>To save on costs, the responses are short (max 50 chars) and sentences may be cut off.</p>
        <p>Since the chat completions API accepts a set of messages and chat history must be sent with every request,
          only the most recent message is sent. Essentially ChatGPT cannot remember (even if past chats were/are stored
          offline).</p>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This ChatGPT clone uses the Open AI API, specifically the chat completions API. ChatGPT is software that
          provides responses to sets of textual chat messages. It can do many tasks and follow instructions (must be
          included in each message for now).</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Send a message to ChatGPT</li>
          <li>Receive a response from ChatGPT</li>
          <li>Chat history is displayed</li>
          <li>The user can have multiple chat conversatons and maintain separate histories for each chat conversation.
          </li>
          <li>Not ready yet: Chat history is stored in the browser's local storage</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Chat History</h2>
        <p>Chat history is not yet stored in the browser's local storage. This means that chat history will be lost if
          the
          browser cache is cleared or if the page is refreshed. The code for is there and should work, but I haven't
          added the offline storage feature yet due to time constraints (testing, debugging, etc.)</p>
